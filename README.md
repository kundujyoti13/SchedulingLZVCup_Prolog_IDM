## Overview

In this project assessment you are to submit a **team code and report** and **individual video** presentations on the problem of _designing complex sport game fixtures_. Your system will need to be able to make decision regarding when, where, and how teams should play during a season. The domain will have specific hard and soft constraints that your decision making system would need to adhere too. There will be different level of achievements; see The Problem section below.

The overarching aim of this project is that you go _deep_ on the problem and that you are able to communicate the problem, results, and learning achieved, both written and orally. In doing so, you are expected to seek and read the relevant literature (e.g., scientific papers, manuals, technical reports, etc.), develop the necessary code, design, run and analyse experiments, integrate the content and findings, and report it all, both written and orally.

The project will be composed of three submissions: proposal, report (with code), and video. Each component is be explained below. When in doubt, please ask the teaching staff in advance.

Read below for detailed information about the domain problem, deliverables, and general guidelines. When clarification or further explanation is needed, ask in the [Course EdStem Discussion Forum](https://edstem.org/au/courses/11583/).

**Corrections:** From time to time, students or staff find errors (e.g., typos, unclear instructions, etc.) in the assignment specification. In that case, a corrected version of this or other files will be produced, announced, and distributed for you to commit and push into your repository.  Because of that, you are **NOT to modify _any_ file provided in your initial repo in any way** to avoid conflicts.

**We are here to help!:** But we don't know you need help unless you tell us. We expect reasonable effort from your side, but if you get stuck or have doubts, please seek help (in workshops or forum). Remember, if in doubt whether a questions is appropriate, you can make a _PRIVATE_ post a to the teaching staff.

## Guidelines

Please make absolutely sure you adhere to the following base rules and guidelines:

* You must ALWAYS keep your fork **private** and **never share it** with anybody in or outside the course, except your teammates, _even after the course is completed_. You are **not allowed to make another repository copy outside the provided GitHub Classroom** without the written permission of the teaching staff.

* Your code **must compile and run _error-free_**. Staff will not debug/fix any code. If your code crashes, it will attract zero marks and will not warrant re-submission. See [`GENERAL_GUIDELNES.md`](GENERAL_GUIDELINES.md) for general guidelines and recommendations.

* You must **use your project Github** repository and GitHub team to collaborate among the members. The group will have write access to the same repository, and also be members of a GitHub team, where members can, and are expected to, engage in discussions and collaboration. See below for more details.

### Submissions

There are several submission pieces for this project. In most cases, it will involve _tagging_ the commit you want to submit and be marked. Commit submissions should always be in `main` branch (so if you were working one branch, you should merge to `main`). The tagging should be performed before the deadline. 

Remember that a git _tag_ is a name given to a specific commit in your git history. It is NOT a branch nor a commit message nor a release (none of these will be be counted as tags and no marking will be done on them). For more info on (re)tagging, please read [this question](https://github.com/RMIT-COSC2780-IDM23/IDM23-DOC/blob/main/FAQ-GIT.md#how-do-i-change-the-submission-tag-if-i-have-already-tagged-one-commit-for-submission).

Refer to each individual deliverable piece below for instructions on their submission.

**Late submissions & extensions:** A penalty of 10% of the maximum mark per day will apply to late assignments. Extensions will only be permitted in _exceptional_ circumstances under RMIT policy (e.g., health or unexpected emergency issues). A heavy load, other course assessments, or other commitments outside are _not_ grounds for extensions; students should manage and plan their time and workload effectively.

**Silent Policy:** A silent policy will take effect 2 days before due date. This means that no question about this assignment will be answered, whether it is asked on the newsgroup, by email, or in person after that time.

### SE & Git practices

We  will inspect the commit history, issue tracker, project, and discussion section in your **remote repo** to check for quality and professional SE practices and evidence of meaningful contributions from each member, including good use of Git version control and project management during the project. Please refer to the course [SE and Git Best Practice](SE-PRACTICES.md) page.

Note that the results of these checks can affect the overall individual marks significantly, as point and/or weight deductions may be applied when poor SE practices have been used or no clear evidence of contributions can be found. For example, few commits with a lot of code changes, or no or poor communication in the corresponding GitHub team may result in deductions, even if the performance of the submission is excellent.

### Evaluation

Rubrics for the components can be found in file [`RUBRICS.md`](RURBICS.md).

Besides the technical judgement of a submission component, points and/or weight deductions/bonus may be applied to individual members depending on the evidence of personal contributions and quality of SE practices demonstrated along the project.

Finally, **we reserve the right to call for team and/or individual interviews when needed.** The interview can significantly affect the final mark of the team or of an individual.

### Academic Integrity

This is an advanced course, so we expect full professionalism and ethical conduct. Because it is small, the teaching staff is well aware of each student contributions.

Plagiarism, or just cheating, is a serious offence. Please **don't let us down and risk our trust**.  If you do, we will pursue the strongest consequences available to us according to the **University Academic Integrity policy**. In a nutshell, **never look at solution done by others**, either in (e.g., classmate) or outside (e.g., web) the course: they have already done their learning, this is your opportunity! If you refrain from this behaviour, you are safe.

Please refer to the course [Academic Integrity](ACADEMIC_INTEGRITY.md) page for more information, including when [integrity when dealing with code](CODE-INTEGRITY.md). You must read this and be fully aware of the "rules of the game"; not reading it will not be an excuse.

Whenever in doubt whether something is acceptable or not, contact the teaching staff to discuss and check. They will appreciate you checking beforehand.

We expect enrolled students/learners to take full **ownership** of their work and **respect** the work of teachers and other fellow students. _Any behaviour or code providing an unfair advantage or causing harm will be treated very seriously._ We trust you, do not let us down.

## The Problem

The project involves the [Scheduling the LZV Cup](https://robinxval.ugent.be/Research/indoor.php), a time-relaxed double round robin scheduling task for an amateur indoor football association. In a nutshell, you need to investigate how to use AI Declarative Programming to make effective decisions on designing sport tournaments.

 </p>

There is a _core_ part of the project and an _extension_ part (for those aiming for DI/HD level).

**Note:** while not part of the core objective, the development of quality tools---e.g., for experiments, interaction, or visualisation---during the project will also be taken into account positively at evaluation/marking time.

### 1. Core (PA/CR)

At the very minimum, your team should effectively address the problem using Answer Set Programming via Clingo, as well as report experimental results.

The experimental section should of course compare with the results reported in the research paper of the Scheduling the LZV Cup page. However, note that it is not mandatory that you beat those results, you may not be able to; but you want to understand and report the differences/gaps. 

This core part could achieve up to a CREDIT level, provided deep and meaningful experiments and discussions are provided. The teaching staff reserve the right to grant higher levels in extraordinary cases.

### 2. Extension (DI/HD)

To achieve DISTINCTION or HIGH DISTINCTION level, your team should address the core part successfully and _go beyond_.

One way to go beyond the core, is to develop a solutions to the problem in another constraint-based programming framework, and report comparative experiments. This could very well be CLP using SWI-Prolog, but it could also be any other appropriate system beyond CLP or ASP your team may research and find. 

Another way to "go beyond" is to provide a deep and interesting experimental evaluation with analysis of your ASP solution, including experimenting with Clingo options. This should go beyond what one would expect as the basic experimental evaluation for a proposed solution.

You may also propose (and discuss) your own extension to the teacher. Please discuss beforehand to make sure is realistic and meaningful.

## Deliverables

The project involves three submissions, as per dates and weights at the top of this file.

### 1. Project proposal

At the start, the team will hand-in a 2-3 pages **project proposal** PDF document explaining what the team will work on do and how, including at least:

1. A high-level, but high-quality, explanation of the problem to be studied and tackled. This ma y include some initial relevant literature/sources to be used (although in the process more sources will be found and used).
2. An explanation of how the team will work together during the weeks until submission. This can include, but it is not limited to, division of tasks and/or cooperation, availability of members, strength and weakness of each member, schedules for meetings (once a week, twice a week; online, face-to-face, mixed, etc.), technologies to be used, agreed team dynamics and commitments, expectations, etc. This explanation should provide strong evidence that the team has seriously discussed the project together, what they will aim for, and how they will work together towards its success.
3. Signatures of each member at the end of the proposal, indicating that the member agrees with the proposal (and was active in building it).

The PDF proposal is to be committed and pushed into the `main` branch of this GitHub repository as a file `proposal.pdf` and with the corresponding git commit tag `proposal`. The file should be placed in the root of the repo.

While you can use Week 7's workshop to work on this proposal, the team should also probably meet outside the workshop and each individual do their own reading and thinking.

### 2. Project code & report

The report itself will be due at the end of Week 12 and will be the main output of the assessment, together with the accompanying code and experiments. The report should be a file named `report.pdf`, and the commit should be done in the `main` branch with corresponding tag `final`. The file should be placed in the root of the repo.

In addition to tagging your submission point in the repo, _each member_ must fill the following _"[Project Certification and Contribution Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdv3G6Dcx1vk9bge7TR5V3Ov6t5jC-jga5XAk8KGT4fnLzRxg/viewform)"_. Members who do not certify their submission will not be marked and will be awarded zero marks. The deadline for this form is **Tuesday May 30th, 11:59pm**.

The report must be a technical one. Thus, besides using correct spelling and grammar, it should use adequate _academic technical language and style_, similar to academic books or papers. Stay away from informal English or subjective claims. Pay special attention to its organisation, punctuation, capitalisation, grammar, and flow. The report should be enjoyable to read and provide concrete evidence that the work done was at the right level.

The report should be no more than 20 pages with font no smaller than 11pt. We recommend using LaTex typesetting system; check [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). The report may include snippets of code (with corresponding explanations), but only when these are interesting and help understand the discussion. Do not list large chunks of code. It may also include tables and/or graphs reporting experimental results.

Regarding the code, your solution must include scripts to read instance encodings and produce calendars in the standard format. We strongly recommend doing this in Python, which integrates nicely with Clingo. Please explain clearly in the report how your system is to be used, including using those scripts.

In your repo, you can, and most probably will, create your own folders where you can save all the relevant material for the project, including code, relevant papers, experimental data and results, source code of report, etc. Material or resources outside this repo and not freely available via a link will not be considered.


### 3. Project video

Finally, a 10' **individual** video presentation is to be submitted. Each student is to submit their own presentation.

The video should be self-contained and cover the whole project carried out by all the members. This means that every student is meant to have a good understanding of the overall project, not just of a part of it. A student can put more emphasis on a given part of the project, but it also has to demonstrate knowledge of the other parts as well.

Each student video should be made available as an [unlisted video](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) in YouTube.

Also, as in a face-to-face presentation, each presenter needs to shown in the presentation.

Please submit your video in the [Video Submission Form](https://forms.gle/nn2W7cJbgEfW6psG6).

## Course Code of Honour & Fair Play

We expect every RMIT student taking this course to adhere to the **Course Code of Honour** under which every learner-student should:

* Submit their own original work.
* Do not share answers with others.
* Report suspected violations.
* Not engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve their results or dishonestly improve or damage the results of others.

If you are in doubt of whether something would break the good spirit of the project, you must check with us early, not wait to be discovered. Remember: **we are here to help you learn**, so _**help us to help you!**_

## Conclusions

This is the end of the project assessment specification.

If you still have doubts about the project and/or this specification do not hesitate asking me the [Course EdStem Discussion Forum](https://edstem.org/au/courses/11583/) and I will try to address it as quickly as we can. Remember I am here to help you learn!

**I very much hope you enjoy the project and new learn much from it!**

**GOOD LUCK & ENJOY IT!**

Sebastian
